# Interactive Playground

Try Pocket directly in your browser. Edit the code, see live results — no installation required.

## What's in the Playground

The playground includes a complete todo app demonstrating:

- **Database creation** with in-memory storage
- **CRUD operations** — insert, update, delete documents
- **Reactive queries** — live-updating query results
- **Query explorer** — write filter JSON and see results in real time
