# Interactive Playground

Try Pocket directly in your browser. Edit the code, see live results — no installation required.

import LivePlayground from '@site/src/components/LivePlayground';
import StackBlitzEmbed from '@site/src/components/StackBlitzEmbed';

## 🔬 Live REPL

Write code in the editor and press **Shift+Enter** to execute. Select a pre-loaded dataset from the dropdown to get sample data instantly. Share your snippets using the **Share** button — the URL encodes your code and dataset selection.

<LivePlayground height="500px" />

## StackBlitz Playground

For a full-featured IDE experience with React components and imports, use the StackBlitz-powered playground:

<StackBlitzEmbed />

## What's in the Playground

The playground includes pre-loaded datasets demonstrating:

- **Database creation** with in-memory storage
- **CRUD operations** — insert, update, delete documents
- **Reactive queries** — live-updating query results
- **Query explorer** — write filter JSON and see results in real time
- **Shareable URLs** — encode your code snippets and share them via URL

## Pre-loaded Datasets

| Dataset | Contents | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **E-Commerce** | Products, orders, users | Filtering, aggregation, joins |
| **Task Manager** | Tasks, projects | Status filtering, priority sorting |
| **Blog** | Posts, authors, comments | Relationships, content queries |

## Run Locally

```bash
cd examples/playground
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
