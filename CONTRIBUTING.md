   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pocket.git
   cd pocket
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install

3. **Build all packages**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. **Run tests**

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write code following the existing style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck
```

### 4. Lint and Format

```bash
# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Fix lint issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Check formatting
pnpm format:check

# Fix formatting
pnpm format
```

### 5. Validate Your Changes

Before pushing, run the full CI suite locally to catch issues early:

```bash
pnpm validate
```

This runs build → lint → typecheck → test in sequence. It's the same checks CI will run, saving you iteration time.

> ⚠️ **Memory Warning**: Running all tests at the root may require extra memory. If you hit OOM errors:
> ```bash
> NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm validate
> ```

### 6. Create a Changeset

If your change affects any published packages, create a changeset:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to describe your changes. This helps generate changelogs and version bumps.

**Changeset examples:**

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example Description |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Bug fix | `patch` | Fix IndexedDB query performance for large collections |
| New feature | `minor` | Add cursor-based pagination to query builder |
| Breaking change | `major` | Rename `createDb` to `createDatabase` |

✅ Good: "Fix race condition in sync engine when reconnecting"
❌ Bad: "Fixed stuff"

### 7. Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a pull request against the `main` branch
3. Fill out the PR template
4. Wait for CI to pass
5. Request a review

## Code Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript (all strict checks are enabled)
- Avoid `any` when possible; use `unknown` and type narrowing
- Export types that consumers need
- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Aim for high coverage on critical paths
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issues when relevant (e.g., "Fix #123")
